                <p style="font-size: 18px; color:#e5e7eb;">Here we remember  those that fell in the Fey. <br>
                                                             Their deaths were not noble, nor were they courageous.<br>
                                                             They did not fall with grace, nor did they meet their end with songs waiting to be sung.<br>
                                                             They will most likey be forgotten where they rot.<br>
                                                             The DM did say they came back at the end, but we all know that was a lie.<br>
                                                             A lie like you would tell ahcild so they do not cry about their lost toy.<br>
                                                             This page is to remember them.<br>
                                                             Not as heroes, but as echoes of lives once lived.</p>
