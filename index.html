                <h1 >The Dead Dummies</h1>
                <p>Here we remember  those that fell in the Fey. Their deaths were not noble, nor were they courageous.                                                      They did not fall with grace, nor did they meet their end with songs waiting to be sung.
                    They will most likey be forgotten where they rot.
                    The DM did say they came back at the end, but we all know that was a lie.
                    A lie like you would tell ahcild so they do not cry about their lost toy.
                    This page is to remember them.
                    Not as heroes, but as echoes of lives once lived.</p>
